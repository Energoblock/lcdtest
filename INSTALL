Building lcdtest uses SCons and Python, rather than Make.  SCons
is used because it has automatic dependency analysis.
SCons version 1.20 or newer is required.

To build lcdtest, simply type "scons".  This will result in the
binary being built in the "build" subdirectory.

The binary can be tested by running "build/lcdtest".

To install the binary and man page in the default locations (/usr/local/bin
and /usr/local/share/man/man1), type "scons install".

To install in other locations, use the prefix, bindir, mandir, and
datadir command-line arguments to scons.  For instance, to use
/usr/bin and /usr/man, type "scons install prefix=/usr mandir=man"
